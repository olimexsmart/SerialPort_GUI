# SerialPort_GUI
This is an application I developed in response of my own needs.
I needed a simple and standalone serial port terminal that I could use 
in my Arduino and mBed projects. The existing applications, like Termite 
and Putty, have a lot of useless functions to me and a complex setup.

There are a lot of things that could be made better and there are some bug for sure,
like the autoscroll and the crash when the device is suddenly disconnected.
I am looking forward to solve these problems and add new and useful features.
